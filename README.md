# earthquake-death-correlation
Aims to answer the questions:
Is an earthquake's focal depth (depth of hypocenter below Earth's surface) or magnitude more strongly correlated with the number of deaths resulting from that earthquake?
What is the death toll for each earthquake magnitude class (a categorical description of an earthquake's magnitude)?
Does earthquake death toll follows the severity of earthquake magnitude?
